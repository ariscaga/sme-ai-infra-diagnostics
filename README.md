# **SME AI Infrastructure Diagnostics**

Tools, schemas, and operating frameworks for evaluating and improving AI readiness in small and midsized enterprises.
Designed to help organizations transition from fragmented AI experimentation to coherent, scalable AI infrastructure.

---

## **Purpose of This Repository**

Most organizations are adopting AI, but few are building the underlying infrastructure needed to **scale it safely, reliably, and coherently**.

This repository highlights selected components of the diagnostic and operating model frameworks used at **Nadis Intelligence™** to help leadership teams:

* Identify infrastructure gaps before scaling breaks
* Evaluate AI readiness using structured, repeatable input schemas
* Replace reactive tool sprawl with coherent operating models
* Improve decision velocity and integration reliability

> This repo focuses on the *infrastructure layer* required for sustainable AI adoption—not the applications themselves.

## **How These Tools Are Used**

These frameworks support advisory and infrastructure design work at Nadis Intelligence:

### **SCALE Factor™ (AI readiness scoring)**

A structured assessment used to measure infrastructure coherence and identify scaling risks before AI adoption accelerates.

### **AI Operating Model Design**

Used in consulting engagements to align workflows, governance, tools, and data paths into a coherent operating blueprint.

### **Infrastructure Audits**

Templates and schemas are applied during readiness evaluations for small and midsized businesses preparing for AI deployment.

### **Workshops & Founder Enablement**

These tools serve as foundational materials in AI readiness bootcamps and leadership workshops focused on operational alignment.

## **Why Infrastructure Matters**

AI isn’t just a model problem — **it’s an infrastructure problem**.

Organizations that adopt LLMs without addressing fragmented workflows, misaligned systems, and unclear ownership accumulate **incoherence debt**:

* duplicated workflows
* redundant tooling
* integration failure points
* unpredictable AI behavior
* misaligned data flows
* high operational cost

This repository captures the scaffolding required to move from **reactive AI adoption** to **infrastructure-first AI design**.
